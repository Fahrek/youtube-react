# React example app

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You may checkout tags to see the project in each step. For example `git checkout step01` to see the app in its first step. List all tags (steps) with `git tag -n`.

## First steps for using create-react-app

1. Install node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Install [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app): `npm install --global create-react-app`.
3. You may use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install local node packages: `npm install --global yarn`.  Then you could do `yarn add PACKAGE` instead of `npm install --save PACKAGE`.
4. Execute `create-react-app PROJECT_NAME`. Then you can enter `cd PROJECT_NAME` and execute `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the app.
